# Trivia App
This app makes an api call to the Open Trivia database to return trivia questions for the user to answer.

## Motivation
I like trivia and I think this is a fun and easy wasy for users to access a good source of many questions.

## Build Status
This project is in its "mvp" state.  I hope to incorporate several additional features including:  keeping score, enabling users to select specific categories, etc.
